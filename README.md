## RESOURCES
This project uses different resources files.

These files are stored in the resources folder of the WordCreator project.

You can update them as much as you want (adding/removing lines).

## How does it work ?
This project uses files of words to do some analysis and use them to create new words. Basically, it will look for all the bigrams (couple of letters) of a word and save their frequency of appearing. It will also save the frequency of all the next letters that will appear after a bigram.

It works like a decision tree. When you have your first bigram (like "be" in this example), the program will randomly choose one of the next letters that can fit. We won't find abberations like finding "mlfpxct" thanks to this method, but only words that could have the most chance to appears.

## Architecture
You will find only 3 javaclass :

First, the Launcher.java class : It's the entry point (the Main class) that's allow you to use different functions of the program.

Then, you have the WordAnalyzerManager.java class : The interface that will read files and use them to create analysis (mostly read, write and process the analyzer).

And last, the WordAnalyzer.java class : the heart of this program. It will parse a word and analyze it structure to get the most precise analysis it can.
